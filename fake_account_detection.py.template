This is a template file. Replace this with your actual fake_account_detection.py file.

Your file should implement a detect_fake_account function that:
1. Takes a platform name and a list of image paths
2. Analyzes the images to determine if they represent a fake account
3. Returns a dictionary with the following keys:
   - isReal (boolean): Whether the account is likely real
   - confidenceScore (number): A score from 0-100 indicating confidence
   - explanation (string): A human-readable explanation of the result
